This repository demonstrates how to automate the deployment process of a web project to a remote server via FTP using GitHub Actions. It provides an easy and efficient way to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for projects hosted on GitHub.

## Overview

This CI/CD pipeline is triggered on every push to the `main` branch, ensuring that the latest version of the project is deployed to the remote server. It uses the GitHub Actions workflow.
